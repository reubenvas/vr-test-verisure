// main.scss file contains imports for the partials files.
// As an example weâ€™ve included three Sass partials files:
// _variables.scss to declare variables for colors, fonts, etc.;
// _mixins.scss which includes an example mixin to make a box resizeable;
// _base.scss which includes the basic styles for the application.

@import "partials/_base.scss";
